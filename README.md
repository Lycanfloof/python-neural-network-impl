# Basic Neural Network implementation.

As the title suggests, this is an implementation of a Neural Network. It features:

- An implementation of a Dense Layer.
- An implementation of an Activation Layer.
- An implementation of the back/forward propagation algorithm.
- Customization with epochs and a few activation functions.
- Customization of the NN architecture.

You can find the mathematical process in the 'docs' folder both in PDF and MarkDown.
